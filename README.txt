Jarvis,

I have everything implemented but when I choose to save a file I get a null pointer, because when i click the save button the InetSocketAddress object
that I create is null.

I am pretty close to done so I am pretty upset about it. Note that I made it to the end of the project trying to download the file from the server.
I did just about zero testing until the end.


Thanks for giving us a chance at partial credit

Eric
